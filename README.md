## Synopsis

tps-test is my new try to create some Third Person Shooter kinda game.
It's created in Ruby, using Gosu / Ruby-OpenGL. It will be a 3D game displaying 3D graphics for environment, and sprites for characters mapping 3D planes.

## Code Example

The code is being created from scratch. It will change quite all the time until it's finished. 

## Motivation

I try to create a 3D game using Ruby, which is not that easy. I try also to reduce the needed dependencies as much as possible.

## Installation

Follow instructions from here : https://www.libgosu.org/
I can be tricky to get Gosu working on Linux. You should really pay attention to the explanations.

For Ruby-OpenGL to work on Windows, you must install the dev-kit. Everything can be found on http://rubyinstaller.org/
